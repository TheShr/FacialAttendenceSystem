# Facial Attendance System

## Overview
The **Facial Attendance System** is an automated solution that uses facial recognition technology to mark attendance for students or employees. This system eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in attendance management. It utilizes machine learning models for facial recognition and can generate attendance reports.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Facial Recognition**: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models (OpenCV, Dlib, or FaceNet) to identify and match faces in real time.
- **Automatic Attendance Marking**: Automatically marks attendance when a recognized face is detected.
- **Attendance Logs and Reports**: Records attendance in a database and generates CSV reports for easy tracking.
- **Database Integration**: Uses a backend database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store facial data and attendance records.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple GUI for easy interaction with the system.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Stores only facial features, not full images, ensuring privacy and security.

## Requirements
### Hardware:
- Webcam or external camera for capturing faces.

### Software:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `dlib` or `face_recognition`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `Tkinter` (for GUI)
  - `sqlite3` or `MySQL` (for database)
- Jupyter Notebook/IDE (for development)
